# SPDX License List Data

This folder contains known SPDX licenses, as published [here](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data).

While poky comes with it's own spdx license list (poky/meta/files/spdx-licenses.json),
the license list data version must align with the CycloneDX spec version.
For example, CycloneDX 1.4 uses [v3.12](https://github.com/CycloneDX/specification/blob/1.4/schema/spdx.schema.json#L4)
