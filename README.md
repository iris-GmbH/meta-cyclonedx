# meta-cyclonedx

`meta-cyclonedx` is a [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) meta-layer which produces [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) Software Bill of Materials (aka [SBOM](https://www.ntia.gov/SBOM)) from your root filesystem.

This repository is forked from [BG Networks repository](https://github.com/bgnetworks/meta-dependencytrack) but differs by the following:

- Direct integration with DependencyTrack has been removed in favour of generic CycloneDX support.
- Support for multiple supported Yocto (LTS) releases.
- Improved package matching against the [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) by fixing [CPE](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) generation process.
- Included [purl](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) package urls.
- Added generation of an additional CycloneDX VEX file which contains information on patched and ignored CVEs from within the OpenEmbedded build system.
- Added option to reduce the SBOM size by limiting to runtime packages ([which might potentially come at some expense](#potentially-missing-packages-after-runtime-filtering))

## Installation

To install this meta-layer simply clone the repository into the `sources` directory and add it to your `build/conf/bblayers.conf` file:

```sh
$ cd sources
$ git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/meta-cyclonedx.git
```

and in your `bblayers.conf` file:

```sh
BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-cyclonedx"
```

## Configuration

To enable and configure the layer simply inherit the `cyclonedx-export` class in your `local.conf` file and then set the following variable:

```sh
INHERIT += "cyclonedx-export"
```

By default, meta-cyclonedx will only include runtime packages in its sbom and vex export files which drastically reduces the number of packages. However, this can lead to valid packages being omitted from the bom ([see](#potentially-missing-packages-after-runtime-filtering)). If desired, you can enable to include all packages at build-time by setting `CYCLONEDX_RUNTIME_PACKAGES_ONLY = "1"` in your `local.conf`.

## Usage

Once everything is configured simply build your image as you normally would.

By default the final CycloneDX SBOMs are saved in the folder `${DEPLOY_DIR}/cyclonedx-export` as `bom.json` and `vex.json` respectively.

## Uploading to DependencyTrack (tested against DT v4.11.4)

While this layer does not offer a direct integration with DependencyTrack (we consider that a feature, since it removes dependencies to external infrastructure in your build), it is perfectly possible to use the produced SBOMs within DependencyTrack.

At the time of writing DependencyTrack does not support uploading component and vulnerability information in one go (which is why we currently create two separate files). The status on this may be tracked [here](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/919).

### Manual Upload

1. Go into an existing project in your DependencyTrack instance or create a new one.
2. Go to the *Components* tab and click *Upload BOM*.
3. Select the `bom.json` file from your deploy directory.
4. Wait for the vulnerability analysis to complete.
5. Go to the *Audit Vulnerabilities* tab and click *Apply VEX*.
6. Select the `vex.json` file from your deploy directory.

### Automated Upload

You may want to script the upload of the SBOMs to DependencyTrack, e.g. as part of a CI job that runs after your build is complete.

This is possible by leveraging DependencyTracks REST API.

At the time of writing this can be done by leveraging the following API endpoints:

1. `/v1/bom` for uploading the `bom.json`.
2. `/v1/event/token/{uuid}` for checking the status on the `bom.json` processing.
3. `/v1/vex` for uploading the `vex.json`.

Please refer to [DependencyTracks REST API documentation](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/integrations/rest-api/) for the usage of these endpoints as well as the required token permissions.

In the future we might include an example script in this repository.

## Known Limitations

### Potentially Missing Packages after Runtime-Filtering

We use the `image_list_installed_packages` function from upstream OpenEmbedded as a means to reduce the SBOM to packages that are added to the final rootfs. This drastically reduces the "noise" generated by CVEs in build-time dependencies. This however comes with some potential downsides (i.e. missing some packages), as discussed [here](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/meta-cyclonedx/issues/9#issue-2494183505).

### Missing Dependencies with Modern Programming Languages

OpenEmbedded and its core mechanisms work best with "traditional" programming languages such as C and C++, as these are the languages that it were additionally designed around. For instance, a core-assumption prevalent in many OE mechanisms (including those we depend on in meta-cyclonedx) is that each library is described in its own OE recipe. This however does not work well with many modern programming languages that come with their own package manager (e.g. NPM, Cargo, Go Modules, ...) that do not necessarily integrate well into OpenEmbedded and pull hundreds of external dependencies (good luck writing a separate OE recipe for each dependency in a small-medium sized Node.js project).

Thus, if you rely on packages written in programming languages that come with their own package managers you might be better of by using a divide and conquer approach for creating complete CycloneDX SBOMs (your mileage may vary):

1. Use this meta-layer to generate a CycloneDX SBOM for your OE-based operating system.
2. Use tools for generating a CycloneDX SBOM for that particular programming language (e.g. [Rust](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-rust-cargo), [NPM](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm), [Golang](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod), ...)
3. Optionally, use some glue code to merge the SBOMs together ([cyclonedx-cli](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli) offers merge functionality)
